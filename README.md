####About
This is an endless runner game that I wrote for fun in Java. You play as monkey trying not to fall off the blocks while also picking up the bananas, canteens and pineapples!<br />
This is built using an implementation of MVC alongside a singleton abstract factory design pattern.

####Features
-The blocks you have to land on are randomly sized with random distances between each block<br />
-There are 4 different types of items that will occasionally sprout that you can grab for bonus points<br />
-The monkey gets a maximum of 2 consecutive jumps (you can jump once mid-air)<br />
-Replay functionality by pressing any key after you've lost<br />
